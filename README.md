  ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  cd knyamedua_ventures_website

  If you are using a different package manager (like Yarn or PNPM), use the appropriate command:

  - Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
  - PNPM:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
  This project uses the following main dependencies (see `package.json` for the full list):

  - **react** – Frontend library for building user interfaces
  - **react-dom** – React DOM rendering support
  - **react-scripts** – Scripts and configuration for Create React App
  - **emailjs-com** – For sending emails from the contact form

  Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system before running these commands.

4. **Run the project:**  
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  This will start the development server. If you are using `email.js` for the contact form, ensure you have configured your EmailJS credentials in your environment variables or configuration file as described in the [EmailJS documentation](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/).

  - If you haven't installed dependencies yet, run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
